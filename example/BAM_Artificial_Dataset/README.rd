The following sample set (BAM.zip and grouping CSV) were generated from a dataset to show off the results of the FANCy pipeline.

The default values on our WAVES FANCy service (A and B for the grouping variable, 0.05 for the pvalue...) were designed specifically for this dataset:

The 0.05 pvalue won't generate a heatmap, though, as there aren't any differentially expressed pathways that are significant in our dataset.
to get an example heatmap too, set the pvalue to 1 (the heatmap in question won't be usable for any conclusions).
