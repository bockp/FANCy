REQUIREMENTS :
  - python and python3
  - perl
  - R

SETUP :
  - Run setup.py
  - following dependancies will be installed :
    * ete2 [python]
    * castor [R]
    * picrust2 dependancies [python] :
      > numpy
   		> h5py
      > joblib
      > biom-format
    * picrust2 [python]

HOW TO USE :
  - run pipeline.py [sample files folder] [output folder] [log folder] [preserve temporary files (1 or 0)]
    (default directories are matchfiles out and log)
    (temporary files can be found in data/tmp, one is the pruned tree in newick format
     and the other the database extracted ko matrix)

OUTPUT :
  - Tango sample matching in out/tango
  - KO prediction by picrust2 and castor
  - Total KO per species
  - Total KO in sample (weighted and not weighted)

LOG :
  - Taxonomic ids of all found taxa
  - Taxonomic ids of all found species
  - All nodes of taxonomic tree
  - Predicted KO
  - Error log (if any)

NOTES :
 - ITS database from unite and ncbi
 - KO database from uniprot and ncbi protein database interpreted through ghostkoala (https://www.kegg.jp/ghostkoala/)
 - The output folder must have a "tango" empty sub-folder, with writing permissions
