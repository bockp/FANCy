- the taxonomy type list is stored in an external file (TaxonomyList)
this list was stored in multiple scripts and if we add a taxonomy type it's more simple when it's centralized in a file
The test is made with a simple "grep" (see preprocess.pl)

- the getoption module is now used for parameters

- some if/else structure are changed to switch/case structure

- the MakeMatrix.pl script compute an ensemble of matrix files
Penalty score is computed with $tp, $fn and $fp variables. We pre-compute an hash stored in a file. This hash in used in the taxonomic assignment step. If the value is pre-computed the hash is used (see penaltyScore function in taxoAssignement.pm)

- lines of match file with only 1 taxonomic id are treated with a specific function (printResultSingle). We do not need to compute a penalty score.

- le contract function for Taxonmy object is not used

- the parsing function of GREENGENES.pm is modified 

- the --q-parameter of tango.pl accept the value "all" to compute the assgnation for every value of q (0 to 1) and store the results is separated files






MATCH FILE FOR TEST 
MP9r2.match
number of taxonomic id associated to the reads : 1 to 10
289813 read with only one taxonomic id 
85244 with multiple taxonomic id
